    "description": "Atop the Radio Tower plays into the humor that is written into our conceptions of reality by turning the power of truth on its head to explore the influence of ideation.  Each compositional element among the m√©lange of forms is unique and powerful in its own right but interacts with and influences the other elements much like loud sounds, vibrant colors and intense emotions dance and crash in dreams or within the mind.  Conceptually, this piece explores how false memories, dreams and illusions can have a profound influence on self-identity.",

The mystical, red-boxed landscape near the top of this piece suggests the existence of a portal into an ethereal utopia, while the dreamy, psychedelic composition mocks the desperation, impulsivity, and tragedy of a societal revolution.",
